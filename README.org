* org-rwtodd.fractals

This is code to play with fractals, just because they are fun!  I have an
older JavaFX project [[https://github.com/rwtodd/Java.JFXMandelbrot][elsewhere on github]].  This time, I
think I'll use ~clojure~ with some ~Swing~.

Actually, this was only going to be a prototype for a less resource-hungry
~Java~ version, but it turned out that the speed and memory usage was not
as bad as I had feared.  So, prototype no more!


** Running

I run the ~uberjar~ with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
-Xmx256m -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=38m 
#+END_EXAMPLE

... and it seems to work well.


** Todo:

If the Label isn't filling the whole frame, or if I go to a
ScrollPane, my method of detecting click locations won't work.  Need
to make a custom panel.
