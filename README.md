# org-rwtodd.fractals

This is code to play with fractals. Because they are fun!  I have an
older JavaFX project [elsewhere on
github](https://github.com/rwtodd/Java.JFXMandelbrot).  This time, I
think I'll use clojure with some Swing.

## Todo:

If the Label isn't filling the whole frame, or if I go to a
ScrollPane, my method of detecting click locations won't work.  Need
to make a custom panel.
